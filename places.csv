Roundel Café	Breakfast, Lunch	2465 East Hastings Street	This place is great because it's a bit off the beaten Commercial Drive track so it's not quiiiite so busy in the weekend-brunch hours (though it is still pretty busy). It's also great because they're into the whole organics/local produce thing but they still serve meat. Some of their food is a bit bland at times, but most things are delicious. Hangover plus: it's painted very soothing colours.
Dockers Diner	Breakfast, Lunch	1869 Powell Street	This place is nothing to write home about really, but it's my hole in the wall greasy spoon of choice. Old-timey dinerish feel, low lights, and they usually play oldies. Good hangover remedy, and the crazy Eastern European ladies who own it are amazing.
Little Nest	Breakfast, Lunch	1716 Charles Street	This place is "kid friendly," which means a lot of things: the tables are spaced well apart, there's a play area, and it's completely packed with hippie moms on the weekends around brunch time. The food is great, but I heartily recommend you go there during the less-busy hours. Unless you LOVE kids and the noise they make.
Sophie's Café	Breakfast, Lunch	2095 West 4th Avenue	This is a place where I take my parents when they visit. It's almost aggressively "funky," full of garage sale junk and bright colours and other such wackiness. But the food is actually pretty good -- sandwiches, burgers, the like -- so it's one of the best bets along 4th Ave. Don’t try to go for weekend brunch, though.
Me & Julio	Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner	2095 Commercial Drive	One of the few genuinely good dining places on the Drive -- it's not a hole in the wall or a hidden treasure, just a nice, clean restaurant you can take your Mom (or your date) to. It's Mexican-inspired (I won't say fusion), but a bit more adventurous than the usual bean/rice/cheese fare.
Havana	Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner	1212 Commercial Drive	The local opinion of this place is resoundingly that it is not as good as it used to be, but the tapas are still tasty, they still make a mean breakfast, people still swear by their sangria, and the patio is still heated and enjoyable for people (and dog) watching. 
Slickety Jim's	Breakfast, Lunch	2513 Main Street	This place is designed with our demographic in mind, which frankly I always find a bit grating. It's a nice place, though, and a good bet for a tasty breakfast probably served by a hot waitress. If it's too full, go to "Nice Café" around the corner.
Seb's	Breakfast, Lunch	592 East Broadway	I've only been here a couple times because it is nowhere near where I used to live, but their brunches are really tasty if you can stomach the "funky" Vancovuer aesthetic. They serve their eggs benny on biscuits -- I mean, come ON!
Templeton	Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Drinks, Open Late	1087 Granville Street	Okay, this is one of the only decent places to get a reasonable meal downtown. It has the look and menu of an old diner, but…updated (meaning, aged white cheddar in the mac-n-cheese and the occasional organic item). You will probably end up here before a concert or something, one day.
Finch's	Lunch, Coffee	353 West Pender Street	Cagibi? What are you doing here in Vancouver? Seriously, though, Finch's is an old favourite of mine for a coffee and a slightly overpriced (but delicious) baguette sandwich. It's a really pleasant space, especially if you can get a window seat. 
Sawa Tea	Lunch	1538 West 2nd Ave	Oh MAN. If you are ever around Granville Island at lunch time, go here for SURE. It was my favourite lunch place when I worked around there. A small, unassuming place with simple, delicious Japanese food -- rice balls and donburi -- made very well. They have a huge tea selection and try to use all organic ingredients. I always feel very happy after eating here.
The Edge Café	Lunch, Coffee, Snacks	2450 Yukon Street	By all appearances just a regular coffee shop/bistro style place, but somehow their soup du jour/paninis/sandwiches/baked goods are just a little bit extra delicious. If you make it in early enough, you can get one of their scones, which are so good they used to be the high point of each and every work day for me.
Coca Moka	Lunch	665 Smithe Street	This place has cute sandwiches that are just like mom probably used to make, and they serve everything with a handful of chips or cheetos on the side. It's a bit of a hidden treasure in the wasteland of downtown.
Brioche	Lunch, Coffee, Snacks	401 West Cordova Street	Your best bet in Gastown. I like this café because they have more substantial fare than just paninis and muffins, and they're licensed. Good for a power lunch.
Sha Lin Noodles	Lunch, Dinner	548 West Broadway	Will BLOW YOUR MIND. Truly authentic Chinese restaurant -- you can watch the chefs hand spin the noodles while you wait. Generally pretty busy, especially at lunch, but worth the wait. Not a fancy place at all.
Nuba	Lunch, Dinner	1206 Seymour Street, 207 West Hastings	This is an amazing cheap/fast/filling Lebanese place. One of my favourite lunch spots in town -- it has a pleasant atmosphere, and every single thing on the menu is just delicious.
La Casita	Lunch, Dinner	101 West Cordova Street	My favourite Mexican place in town. It's in a bit of a sketchy neighbourhood, but is by no means a sketchy establishment. It's really not easy to find decent Mexican in Vancouver, so discovering this place was a very exciting thing for me.
Gojo Little Africa	Lunch, Dinner	2838 Commercial Drive	My favourite Ethiopian place in town. They make their own honey wine, their vegetarian dishes are tasty, and their meat dishes are EXCEPTIONAL. There are other great places on Commercial further down (Addis and Harambe), but this one's worth the extra walking. They're occasionally closed at strange times, though.
Sitar	Lunch, Dinner	8 Powell Street	Great Indian food. A friend of mine once found a cockroach on a table here, but she loved the food so many she kept coming back anyways. I don't know if that's really going to sell it to you, but, you know. Full disclosure.
Ashiana	Lunch, Dinner	1440 Kingsway	Probably my favourite Indian place in town -- a bit of a weird location, but they deliver! The chili chicken, the paneer makhani, and the fish pakoras are all EXTREMELY notable. So good I miss it even in Montreal, where there's no shortage of good Indian restaurants.
Legendary Noodle	Lunch, Dinner	1-4191 Main Street	Like Sha Lin, will BLOW YOUR MIND. Handmade noodles (get the dish with the garlic and lemon infused oil, please, so I can live vicariously through you), life changing dumplings...I once ate here three days in a row, and easily could have made it a fourth.
