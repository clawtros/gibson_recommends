Roundel Café	Breakfast, Lunch	2465 East Hastings Street	This place is great because it's a bit off the beaten Commercial Drive track so it's not quiiiite so busy in the weekend-brunch hours (though it is still pretty busy). It's also great because they're into the whole organics/local produce thing but they still serve meat. Some of their food is a bit bland at times, but most things are delicious. Hangover plus: it's painted very soothing colours.
Dockers Diner	Breakfast, Lunch	1869 Powell Street	This place is nothing to write home about really, but it's my hole in the wall greasy spoon of choice. Old-timey dinerish feel, low lights, and they usually play oldies. Good hangover remedy, and the crazy Eastern European ladies who own it are amazing.
Little Nest	Breakfast, Lunch	1716 Charles Street	This place is "kid friendly," which means a lot of things: the tables are spaced well apart, there's a play area, and it's completely packed with hippie moms on the weekends around brunch time. The food is great, but I heartily recommend you go there during the less-busy hours. Unless you LOVE kids and the noise they make.
Sophie's Café	Breakfast, Lunch	2095 West 4th Avenue	This is a place where I take my parents when they visit. It's almost aggressively "funky," full of garage sale junk and bright colours and other such wackiness. But the food is actually pretty good -- sandwiches, burgers, the like -- so it's one of the best bets along 4th Ave. Don’t try to go for weekend brunch, though.
Me & Julio	Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner	2095 Commercial Drive	One of the few genuinely good dining places on the Drive -- it's not a hole in the wall or a hidden treasure, just a nice, clean restaurant you can take your Mom (or your date) to. It's Mexican-inspired (I won't say fusion), but a bit more adventurous than the usual bean/rice/cheese fare.
Havana	Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Drinks	1212 Commercial Drive	The local opinion of this place is resoundingly that it is not as good as it used to be, but the tapas are still tasty, they still make a mean breakfast, people still swear by their sangria, and the patio is still heated and enjoyable for people (and dog) watching. 
Slickety Jim's	Breakfast, Lunch	2513 Main Street	This place is designed with our demographic in mind, which frankly I always find a bit grating. It's a nice place, though, and a good bet for a tasty breakfast probably served by a hot waitress. If it's too full, go to "Nice Café" around the corner.
Seb's	Breakfast, Lunch	592 East Broadway	I've only been here a couple times because it is nowhere near where I used to live, but their brunches are really tasty if you can stomach the "funky" Vancovuer aesthetic. They serve their eggs benny on biscuits -- I mean, come ON!
Templeton	Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Drinks, Open Late	1087 Granville Street	Okay, this is one of the only decent places to get a reasonable meal downtown. It has the look and menu of an old diner, but…updated (meaning, aged white cheddar in the mac-n-cheese and the occasional organic item). You will probably end up here before a concert or something, one day.
Finch's	Lunch, Coffee	353 West Pender Street	Cagibi? What are you doing here in Vancouver? Seriously, though, Finch's is an old favourite of mine for a coffee and a slightly overpriced (but delicious) baguette sandwich. It's a really pleasant space, especially if you can get a window seat. 
Sawa Tea	Lunch	1538 West 2nd Ave	Oh MAN. If you are ever around Granville Island at lunch time, go here for SURE. It was my favourite lunch place when I worked around there. A small, unassuming place with simple, delicious Japanese food -- rice balls and donburi -- made very well. They have a huge tea selection and try to use all organic ingredients. I always feel very happy after eating here.
The Edge Café	Lunch, Coffee, Snacks	2450 Yukon Street	By all appearances just a regular coffee shop/bistro style place, but somehow their soup du jour/paninis/sandwiches/baked goods are just a little bit extra delicious. If you make it in early enough, you can get one of their scones, which are so good they used to be the high point of each and every work day for me.
Coca Moka	Lunch	665 Smithe Street	This place has cute sandwiches that are just like mom probably used to make, and they serve everything with a handful of chips or cheetos on the side. It's a bit of a hidden treasure in the wasteland of downtown.
Brioche	Lunch, Coffee, Snacks	401 West Cordova Street	Your best bet in Gastown. I like this café because they have more substantial fare than just paninis and muffins, and they're licensed. Good for a power lunch.
Sha Lin Noodles	Lunch, Dinner	548 West Broadway	Will BLOW YOUR MIND. Truly authentic Chinese restaurant -- you can watch the chefs hand spin the noodles while you wait. Generally pretty busy, especially at lunch, but worth the wait. Not a fancy place at all.
Nuba - Hastings location	Lunch, Dinner	207 West Hastings	This is an amazing cheap/fast/filling Lebanese place. One of my favourite lunch spots in town -- it has a pleasant atmosphere, and every single thing on the menu is just delicious.
Nuba - Seymour location	Lunch, Dinner	1206 Seymour Street	This is an amazing cheap/fast/filling Lebanese place. One of my favourite lunch spots in town -- it has a pleasant atmosphere, and every single thing on the menu is just delicious.
La Casita	Lunch, Dinner	101 West Cordova Street	My favourite Mexican place in town. It's in a bit of a sketchy neighbourhood, but is by no means a sketchy establishment. It's really not easy to find decent Mexican in Vancouver, so discovering this place was a very exciting thing for me.
Gojo Little Africa	Lunch, Dinner	2838 Commercial Drive	My favourite Ethiopian place in town. They make their own honey wine, their vegetarian dishes are tasty, and their meat dishes are EXCEPTIONAL. There are other great places on Commercial further down (Addis and Harambe), but this one's worth the extra walking. They're occasionally closed at strange times, though.
Sitar	Lunch, Dinner	8 Powell Street	Great Indian food. A friend of mine once found a cockroach on a table here, but she loved the food so many she kept coming back anyways. I don't know if that's really going to sell it to you, but, you know. Full disclosure.
Ashiana	Lunch, Dinner	1440 Kingsway	Probably my favourite Indian place in town -- a bit of a weird location, but they deliver! The chili chicken, the paneer makhani, and the fish pakoras are all EXTREMELY notable. So good I miss it even in Montreal, where there's no shortage of good Indian restaurants.
Legendary Noodle	Lunch, Dinner	1-4191 Main Street	Like Sha Lin, will BLOW YOUR MIND. Handmade noodles (get the dish with the garlic and lemon infused oil, please, so I can live vicariously through you), life changing dumplings...I once ate here three days in a row, and easily could have made it a fourth. 
Banana Leaf	Dinner	820 West Broadway	Really great Malaysian food, especially if you like fish. They make this spectacular -- no, transcendent! -- green bean dish with shrimp paste and tomatoes. It's pretty popular, so I'd recommend making a reservation. Truly worth busing your ass out to. 
Guu - Water St. location	Dinner, Drinks, Snacks, Open late	105-375 Water Street	Wonderful, wonderful Japanese tapas -- I've never had a bad thing here, and I've probably ordered everything on the menu at one point or another. Trust me, everything's good. Even (especially?) the more "western" dishes like the lamb hamburg steak. Each location has a slightly different menu/vibe, but I recommend them all heartily.
Guu - Robson St. location	Dinner, Drinks, Snacks, Open late	1698 Robson Street	Wonderful, wonderful Japanese tapas -- I've never had a bad thing here, and I've probably ordered everything on the menu at one point or another. Trust me, everything's good. Even (especially?) the more "western" dishes like the lamb hamburg steak. Each location has a slightly different menu/vibe, but I recommend them all heartily.
Guu - Thurlow St. location	Dinner, Drinks, Snacks, Open late	838 Thurlow Street	Wonderful, wonderful Japanese tapas -- I've never had a bad thing here, and I've probably ordered everything on the menu at one point or another. Trust me, everything's good. Even (especially?) the more "western" dishes like the lamb hamburg steak. Each location has a slightly different menu/vibe, but I recommend them all heartily.
Hapa Izakaya	Dinner, Drinks, Snacks, Open late	1479 Robson Street	 More wonderful Japanese tapas. The decor at this place feels a bit more "hip" and "trendy" than Guu, but it offers very similar fare: sashimi, salads, things wrapped in bacon, creamy desserts, and the like. The patio's nice if, miraculously, it isn't raining.
The Reef - Main St. location	Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Drinks	4172 Main Street	Great Caribbean restaurant! They have excellent jerk chicken, roti, johnny cakes, etc., and a surprisingly impressive cocktail list. Honestly, I think they have more drink options than food choices. Great brunches, too, especially if you can get a seat on the patio (both locations are prime for people-watching). 
The Reef - Commercial Dr. location	Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Drinks	1018 Commercial Drive	Great Caribbean restaurant! They have excellent jerk chicken, roti, johnny cakes, etc., and a surprisingly impressive cocktail list. Honestly, I think they have more drink options than food choices. Great brunches, too, especially if you can get a seat on the patio (both locations are prime for people-watching). 
Prado	Coffee, Snacks	1938 Commercial Drive	Stark, white -- basically looks like the inside of a Mac computer....so it should come as no surprise to be greeted by a little glowing apple on every table. The coffee's really good, though, so if you can't handle all the Macbook-clacking, just get it to go and wander to a park. 
JJ Bean	Coffee, Snacks	1904 Powell Street	There are actually about a million JJ Beans in Vancouver, all with great coffee, but this is the only one I -really- like, maybe because it's a couple blocks from my old apartment. It's also just more relaxed and quiet than the others. It's also got a very comfy, very worn in couch. It's also the only location where you can watch them roast the beans (fascinating!).
Joe's Café	Coffee	1150 Commercial Drive	Good place to drink Italian coffee and get cat called. There are a bunch of other great Italian coffee shops in this neighbourhood, but this is the one I went to the most for whatever reason.
Patisserie Lebeau	Coffee, Snacks	1728 West 2nd Ave	This was my favourite place to stop for a morning coffee/snack when I worked around here. They specialize in WAFFLES! Sweet waffles, savoury waffles, custard-filled waffles, waffle sandwiches, waffles beyond your wildest dreams! Their non-waffle pastries are exceptional, too. Can not recommend highly enough, if you're ever around 4th Ave or Granville Island.
Medina Café	Breakfast, Lunch, Coffee, Snacks	556 Beatty Street	This is truly a hidden gem in a bleak-ish area of downtown Vancouver. The space is really beautiful, the coffee's great, and the food is, well, really special. You can sit in the cafe for a coffee and a waffle, or you can eat in the restaurant space out back. Both experiences are highly recommended. Pretty sure brunch is only on weekends.
The Irish Heather	Dinner, Drinks, Open late	212 Carrall Street	So, get this: it's an Irish pub, right, but it isn't entirely populated by idiots. And the food is actually great (Guinness braised beef pot pie is a favourite). This is a pleasant spot for a pint and a snack, though it's extremely busy on seemingly arbitrary nights, so proceed with caution. 
Shebeen Whiskey House	Dinner, Drinks, Open late	212 Carrall Street	Wonderful, cozy whiskey bar with an insane selection. They share a building and a kitchen with The Irish Heather (so if whiskey's not your thing...go there instead!). The staff here really know your stuff, so you'll probably end up trying something you've never had (or heard of) before. Mmm.
Salt	Snacks, Drinks, Open late	45 Blood Alley	Not the easiest place to find: it's located in an alley, and they only signage is a salt shaker. All they have here is charcuterie, cheese, bread, wine and port -- I know this SOUNDS a bit intimidating, but it's not upscale or overpriced at all, trust me. The staff are really helpful, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic, too, which really adds to the experience. Highly, highly, highly recommend. 
Six Acres	Dinner, Snacks, Drinks, Open late	203 Carrall Street	This place is always a very solid bet for a drink and a bite, though it gets pretty busy on weekends. It's a really pleasant space, they have a HUGE selection of imported beers, they make a mean whiskey sour, and their (ever-changing) food menu is reliably tasty. 
Narrow Lounge	Dinner, Snacks, Drinks, Open late	1898 Main St	Aptly named! It's a tiny, narrow, narrow, narrow space, so it can sometimes be a bit tricky to get a table. Look for the red light -- I don't think there's a sign. They have a really impressive drink list and great comfort food/snacks, and every time I go there, I feel I've stumbled on a magical hidden treasure.
The Brickhouse	Drinks, Open late	730 Main Street	The old standby. Feels like someone's parents' 1970s basement: ugly mismatched couches, board games, weird paperback novels, fish tanks, and a cranky owner wearing bicycle shorts. Best to avoid the beer on tap (hangover city) -- I stick to bottles or whatever the whiskey special is. You can usually enter through the front door, but sometimes you have to knock on the back door in the Extremely Sketchy Alley. 
The Alibi Room	Dinner, Snacks, Drinks, Open late	157 Alexander Street	Good selection of local beer, tasty (if slightly pricey) food. The vibe here can sometimes be somewhere between hip and douchebaggy: better to go on a weeknight, when it's a bit more relaxed. Worth checking out, though, despite the sketchy location. 
Portuguese Club of Vancouver	Dinner, Drinks	1144 Commercial Drive	Looks unwelcoming from the outside, but great once you get in there. I've never eaten dinner here, but I know it's an option, and who knows?, maybe it's good. I can definitely promise drinks, though, not to mention the Portuguese guys trying to steal away any females from your table. Doesn't that sound great? It's great.
Montmartre Cafe	Dinner, Snacks, Drinks	4362 Main Street	Little French style (or, more accurately, French -themed-) cafe, great for a crepe and a glass of wine. Your waitress (the proprietor) will probably be wearing a beret. They occasionally have terrible open mic or jazz shows, but if you can avoid those, the atmosphere is quiet and enjoyable.
Macleod's	Used Books	455 Pender Street West	All the other used bookstore owners in town absolutely hate this place, but I think this has more to do with the owner than the store itself. It's enormous, chaotic, and most likely has whatever it is you're looking for. A bit overpriced, though -- I suspect they keep up their customer base by hiring only super cute nerd girls.
Pulp Fiction	Used Books	2422 Main Street	They usually have a pretty good selection, though they somewhat confusingly have separate sections for "literature" and (mostly Penguin paperback) "classics." Fairly reasonable prices, owned by nice peeps.
Albion Books	Used Books	523 Richards Street	Basically right across the street from Macleod's -- I'd check here first, as the prices are usually a bit better and I don't think this store is exactly thriving (hmm....coincidence?). 
Bibliophile	Used Books	2010 Commercial Drive	Not a HUGE selection, but the prices are reasonable, the owner is nice, and the cat is cute. Worth browsing if you're in the neighbourhood.
Wet Wizard Books	Used Books	248 East Broadway	Try to overlook the name. No one seems to know about this place and it's super cheap. Right around the corner from Pulp Fiction.
The Block	Clothing	350 West Cordova Street	Most reliably nice clothes in town -- the buyer has a discerning eye that I really trust. Bit pricey, though. Helpful, charming, and cute sales girls. I miss this store so much.
Gravity Pope	Shoes, Clothing	2205 West 4th Avenue	The Best Shoe Store In Town. Hands down. Occasionally a bit too "funky," often much, much too expensive, they're still the first stop on any well thought out shoe quest. There's a "Gravity Pope" clothing store right next door, too, which is generally worth a look.
Mintage	Clothing	1714 Commercial Drive	Decent vintage store, with a slightly weird (and occasionally unfortunate) selection of new/locally made/cheap clothes as well. Last I heard, they were going out of business, but through some sort of magic they still seem to be around. For now.
True Value Vintage	Clothing	710 Robson Street	Unfortunately, the vintage clothes here lean overwhelmingly toward the rock t-shirt/Hawaiian print side of things, but they also generally have a few hidden gems. The store is HUGE and they get some genuinely great stuff. 
Eugene Choo	Clothing	3683 Main Street	Reliably nice clothing with a focus on local design. The clothes here can be a bit expensive, but they generally stock the well made, classic kinds of pieces that you can justify dropping some coin on.
Front & Company	Clothing	3772 Main Street	Big consignment shop, spanning three storefronts. I think they have a tiny men's section, but I've never known a guy to have a sweet find here. Sooo, this recommendation is Ladies Only. Right before I left town, a huge portion of the building was lost to a fire, but they should probably be up and running again by now. Surely! 
Lark	Clothing	2315 Main Street	A very well curated clothing shop: some local, some imports, mostly chosen with tailoring in mind. Healthy sized men's section, nice, helpful employees. The space is really beautiful, too -- worth checking out just for that!
Deluxe Junk Co	Clothing	310 West Cordova Street	Big, long established consignment store. Feels not unlike a teen bedroom. Can be a bit hit or miss, but it's fun to sort through. They're the kind of place that has a huge selection of evening gloves, rhinestone jewelry, and funny old hats. You know?
New  Brighton Park	Park, Swimming	N Windermere St	Great park for picnicking! Outdoor pool, right on the water, view of the North Shore, usually full of families (rather than young rowdies).
Maclean Park	Park	Heatley & Keefer	 
Crab Park	Park	101 E Waterfront Rd	Nice, hidden park, right on the water. Good for drinkin' outside!
Third Beach	Swimming	Stanley Park	 
Ping's Café	Dinner	2702 Main Street	Japanese style western comfort food.
